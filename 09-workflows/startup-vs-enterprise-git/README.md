# Git in Startups vs Enterprises

## 📋 Quick Comparison

| Aspect | Startup | Enterprise |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Workflow** | Simple, agile | Formal, structured |
| **Release cycle** | Fast, frequent | Planned, slower |
| **Team size** | Small | Large |
| **Compliance** | Minimal | Strict |
| **Automation** | Basic CI/CD | Advanced DevOps |
| **Branching** | Trunk-based | Git flow |
| **Code review** | Light | Heavy |

## 📖 Startup Workflow

```
- Main branch is production
- Feature branches merged quickly
- Continuous deployment
- Minimum process overhead
- Focus on shipping
```

## 📖 Enterprise Workflow

```
- Multiple long-lived branches
- Formal code review process
- Planned releases
- Compliance and audit trails
- Documentation required
```

## 💡 Key Differences

**Startups:** "Move fast and break things" → Trunk-based, automation

**Enterprises:** "Stability and compliance" → Git Flow, formal review
